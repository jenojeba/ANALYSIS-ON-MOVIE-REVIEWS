# Analysis on Movie Reviews

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. We aim to build a logistic regression model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given movie review based on its text.

## Overview

In this project, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Import the required libraries for data manipulation, NLP, and machine learning.
2. **Load the Data**: Load the IMDB movie reviews dataset and preprocess the text data.
3. **Preprocess the Text Data**: Clean the text data by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating stopwords.
4. **Encode Sentiment Labels**: Convert the sentiment labels into numerical values for binary classification.
5. **Split the Data**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **Transform Text Data to TF-IDF Features**: Convert the text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
7. **Train a Logistic Regression Model**: Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
8. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
9. **Visualize the Results**: Plot the confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance.
